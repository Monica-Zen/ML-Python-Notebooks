## <span style="color:green">1. `AgeOfAbalone.ipynb`: Estimating the Age of Abalone at a Seafood Farm</span>

### <span style="color:red">1.1 Problem Statement</span>
Estimating the age of an abalone traditionally requires counting the number of rings in a cross-section of its shell under a microscope. This technique is laborious and intricate. To assist farmers, a method is needed to estimate the age of abalones based on their physical characteristics.

### <span style="color:purple">1.2 Purpose of Study</span>
Understanding an abalone's age is critical for multiple reasons:
- **Economic Value**: Older abalones are larger and more valuable, influencing market price.
- **Conservation**: Accurate age estimation supports sustainable harvesting, protecting populations from overexploitation.
- **Research and Management**: Age data enables scientific research and effective fisheries management, contributing to studies on growth rates, population dynamics, and overall health.

### <span style="color:orange">1.3 Dataset Overview</span>
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- `sex`: M (male), F (female), I (infant)
- `length`: Longest shell measurement (mm)
- `diameter`: Perpendicular to length (mm)
- `height`: Measured with meat in the shell (mm)
- `whole_wt`: Whole abalone weight (g)
- `shucked_wt`: Abalone meat weight (g)
- `viscera_wt`: Gut weight (g)
- `shell_wt`: Dried shell weight (g)
- `rings`: Number of rings in shell cross-section
- `age`: Calculated as `rings + 1.5`

### <span style="color:brown">1.4 Objectives</span>
Key questions to address:
1. How does weight change with age across the three sex categories?
2. Can an abalone's age be estimated using its physical characteristics?
3. Which variables are the best predictors of age?
4. Develop a machine learning model to estimate abalone age.
